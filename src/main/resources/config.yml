# "Complex percent" growth model:

# where growthMultiplier grows non-linearly and becomes much harder for the last 10 levels.

# You can tune these coefficients:
growth:
  # baseline multiplier increment
  base-mult: 1.085
  # adds a small non-linear bump using sqrt(level)
  sqrt-coef: 0.0025
  # adds a gradual linear bump
  linear-coef: 0.0009

endgame:
  # when level >= this threshold, apply additional endgame difficulty
  threshold: 90
  # extra multiplier (applied on top) for endgame levels
  hard-mult: 1.45
  # quadratic penalty coefficient for levels >= threshold
  quad-coef: 0.010
  # extra exponential penalty coefficient for levels >= threshold
